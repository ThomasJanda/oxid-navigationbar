This module is made for Oxid 6 wave theme.

## Good to know

The module use "scss" instead of "css". For use out of the box you need the "oxid-optimize" module which convert the styles.

Each theme has itÂ´s own "scss" file and you can add your own and link to that in the module settings. The files are located at

    Modules Folder/out/src/css/theme

The navigation bar can display CMS text directly with the menu (only large). To display the CMS-Ident you need, you can enable 
the "Display CMS-Ident for snippets in the navigation bar" to see the CMS-Ident in the shop itself. The CMS-Ident is different 
for each sub menu. Disable this option if you copy and past the CMS-Ident to keep the navigation bar nice for the users.

On touch devices, the root categorie can't click directly if a sub menu is present. Instead opening the categorie, it display/hide
the sub menu on touch.
